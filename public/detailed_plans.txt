Aim to gain 0.25-0.5 kg per week.\n- Protein: 1.8-2.2 g/kg (~120-132 g/day for 60 kg).\n- Fats: ~20-30% of calories.\n- Carbs: remainder to fill calories (prioritize around workouts).\n\nLogging and Progress:
- Always record the highest weight x reps you performed for main lifts each session.
- Try to increase reps each week or add weight once you can do upper bound of rep range for all sets.
\nRecovery:
- Sleep 7-9 hours.\n- Walk 10-30min on off days for circulation, avoid excessive cardio that blunts gains.\n\nSupplement suggestions (optional): whey protein, creatine monohydrate (5g/day), fish oil, multivitamin.
